        May these vows and this marriage be blessed. May it be sweet milk, this
        marriage, like wine and halvah. May this marriage offer fruit and shade
        like the date palm. May this marriage be full of laughter, our every day
        a day in paradise. May this marriage be a sign of compassion, a seal of
        happiness here and hereafter. May this marriage have a fair face and a
        good name, an omen as welcomes the moon in a clear blue sky. I am out of
        words to describe how spirit mingles in this marriage.
